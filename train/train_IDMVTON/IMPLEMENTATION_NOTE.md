# ⚠️ IMPLEMENTATION NOTE

## Current Status: Simplified Reference Implementation

The code in this directory is a **simplified reference implementation** for demonstration and structural purposes. 

### For Production Use

To implement the **exact architecture and loss functions** as described in the original research papers, please refer to:

📄 **`train/ORIGINAL_ARCHITECTURES_REFERENCE.md`**

This document contains:
- ✅ Original paper references with links
- ✅ Exact architectural details
- ✅ Complete loss function formulations
- ✅ Training strategies from papers
- ✅ Implementation notes for accuracy

### Key Differences from Paper

The current implementation may differ from the original paper in:
- Architecture details (simplified networks)
- Loss function components (missing some auxiliary losses)
- Training strategies (simplified training loops)
- Hyperparameters (default values, not paper-tuned)

### Recommended Actions

1. **Read the original paper** for your target model
2. **Consult** `ORIGINAL_ARCHITECTURES_REFERENCE.md` for implementation details
3. **Modify** the code in this directory to match paper specifications
4. **Tune hyperparameters** according to paper recommendations
